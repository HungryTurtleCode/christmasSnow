# Snow is falling

This is a quick little Christmas-themed project I threw together for a [video on Hungry Turtle Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXkkfqEJR8w).

## Wind and gravity

There is another branch of this repo called "wind_and_gravity" where the code has been updated to include wind, gravity and an interesting effect where the snowflakes are attracted to the mouse on right click. All of that was recorded as part of a [follow up video](https://youtu.be/e8ELpEuUng0)
